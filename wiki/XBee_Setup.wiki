= Introduction =
The control system relies on XBee modules to allow our controller to talk to the receiver wirelessly. One module is mounted to the Controller Shield and acts as a 'Coordinator'. Another is mounted to the Receiver Shield and acts as a 'Router' for commands to and from the controller.
= Recommended Parts =
Most XBee parts are available to buy directly from their manufacturer (Digi) or from distributors such as Digi-Key or Newark.

= Configuration =
Before our XBee modules can talk to each other, they need to be configured. This is done by connecting them to a PC and using some software to read and write their settings. To connect the XBee you'll need either an XBee USB Adapter (from [https://www.adafruit.com/products/247 Adafruit] or [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8687 Sparkfun]) that the XBee connects directly to, or you can use an FTDI/USB adapter (from [https://www.adafruit.com/products/284 Adafruit] or [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716 Sparkfun]) to connect via the controller or receiver shields. The shields have a built-in XBee adapter based on an [http://www.ladyada.net/make/xbee/ Adafruit design].
